Store for functions and workflows for kinematic post-hoc data-analysis.

BiKiPy has been under a major overhaul using the LTT Floatplane business strategy for the last 4 years. The work is kept private for my own protection against potential scoops from the scientific world.

Please contact me if you wish to try out the package.
